## Numerical stability analysis and simulation of deterministic systems

.ode files are for phase planes / bifurcation analysis / simulation of 2D version of MMI1 and MMI2-SSB Models (tested in XPPAUT 8.0)

Python scripts are for finding saddle-node and Hopf bifurcation points with parameter sampling and numerical continuation (tested with Python 3.6 and Tellurium 2.1.5 (rrplugins 2.1.1))
